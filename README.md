# Backend Challenge Spring 2024

Hello! This is me, Ayush, and this is my submission for the 2024 Stevens Blueprint Backend Challenge.

In order for everything to work, you must have Insomnia dowloaded. Insomnia is like Postman, but it is what I used in order to use this API.
For my database, I used MongoDB and as for my programming language, I used JavaScript.

In order to use the CRUD methods, you will have to navigate to Insomnia, and create a folder. Once you created a folder, you can name it anything you want, (e.g. "Get Volunteer Method"). Then, you will click the plus 
icon in the folder and create an HTTP request. There, you would type in the http link (e.g. "http://localhost:3000/api/volunteers"...). For which ever method you are testing, you need to specify the method in the drop-down menu
next to the http link (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE...). Then, you will send a json body containing a name and ID if you wanted to POST a volunteer or add one.

In MongoDB, everything is added in realtime using the link at the bottom of index.js. For this challenge, I only decided to stick with the required methods, as it was my first time working with all of this. I did learn a lot and 
managed to get a hold on JavaScipt syntax, how backend operations work, and the nuances of creating and configuring an API. During the coffee chat, I will explain more in depth and show you examples of how it can be used if needed.

This is my submission for the Stevens Blueprint Backend Challenge 2024, and I am excited to potentially be a part of your organization!

Best,
Ayush Misra
